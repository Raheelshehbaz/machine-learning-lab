# 🧠 Machine Learning Lab

This repository contains hands-on lab work, experiments, and mini-projects completed as part of the **Machine Learning Lab** course. The focus is on implementing machine learning models from scratch and using libraries such as **scikit-learn**, **pandas**, and **TensorFlow/PyTorch** for real-world datasets.
